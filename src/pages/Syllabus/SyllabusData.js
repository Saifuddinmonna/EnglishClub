      overview: 'The new curriculum in Bangladesh shifts from rote memorization to competency-based learning. Its core focus is on developing communicative competence in English (effective use in real-life situations) by integrating Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing (LSRW) skills. Learning is interactive, activity-based, experiential, and contextual. Assessment emphasizes continuous formative assessment (Shikhonkalin Mulyayon) and revised summative assessments (Samostik Mulyayon), with "English for Today" textbooks designed for this new approach.',
